Over the years, gang violence and neglect created terrible living conditions for the residents, and the name \"Cabrini–Green\" became synonymous with the problems associated with public housing in the United States. The last of the buildings in Cabrini–Green was demolished in March 2011.\r\n\r\n>[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabrini_Green)\r\n\r\n### Hyde Park 2004-2014\r\n![Hyde Park GIF](https://raw.github.com/oneschirm/crime-study/master/Hyde_Park/Hyde_output.gif)\r\n>Way back in 1952, the wife of a University of Chicago faculty member was assaulted near campus. The university was stung into action, and began to invest heavily in a private security force. It also pushed for urban renewal, in some cases using private police officers to investigate criminal activity in given buildings in order to get the property foreclosed and torn down.\r\n\r\n>[The Atlantic - How Bad Is Violence in Chicago?](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-bad-is-violence-in-chicago-depends-on-your-race/280019/)\r\n\r\n### Data Sources\r\n[Crime Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Police Department uses a modified form of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting codes.
